I want this to be a community wiki, so feel free to:
- review existing contents and report/propose fix for any error you find
- add new sections with abstractions from math, that can be translated into Scala. 
It would be nice if it have some practical benefits but thats a bonus. Maybe it does not have now but will in the future!
- improve existing sections: there are missing Scala implementations that exists in Haskell
- add link to a blogpost, presentation, paper about particular topic
- add description when given abstraction can be usefull

[Good first time issues](https://github.com/lemastero/scala_typeclassopedia/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
But you can pick, whatever is not assigned, or propose help to already assigned ones.

You can edit MD file in place, yet it tends to not appear on your profile on Gighub.
You can apply steps 1 - 3 from [github-flow](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flow/)

Most importantly have fun :)
